# AI200 - Human or Robot?

## My top solution for [AI200 Mar 2022: Human or Robot? Capstone Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai200-mar-2022-human-or-bot) 

###
Adapted from [Facebook Recruiting competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/), the purpose of this competition is to chase down robots for an online auction site. Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.

In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient. 

The goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.
